# BMI Calculator

## Overview

The BMI Calculator is a simple iOS application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user based on their height and weight inputs. The app takes in height and weight inputs using sliders in metric units (meters and kilograms) and calculates the BMI using the formula:

    BMI = weight / (height * height)

The calculated BMI value is then displayed along with a corresponding BMI category to help the user understand their BMI.
